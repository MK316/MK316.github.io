# # ðŸŒ± Spring 2022

: This is the first semester to apply Python based tools to my classroom,  
and it was meanigfully helping create course materials for my students.  
In particular, the material created could help students in need of material assistance  
for self-practice outside the classroom. I'll definitely use more of python codes to create  
customized materials for future classes.
