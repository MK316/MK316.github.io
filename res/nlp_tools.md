‚ñ∂Ô∏è **NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING tools)**:   
üîé _This link includes the following tools._     

‚Ü≥ **Frequency Analysis:** Creating Word Frequency list (csv file), creating Wordcloud with your text.   
‚Ü≥ **Tagging:** Auto text tagging (Part of Speech: POS tagging) and create a wordlist including frequency, words, POS tags.   
‚Ü≥ **Words in Contexts:** Concordance (showing contexts where target words occur), Collocation (words occurring together), N-gram (N words occuring together.  
‚Ü≥ **Lexical Diversity:** 10 mostly used LD measures including TTR, LogTTR, RootTTR, etc. A tool with 3 main LD indices is also provided (MTLD, HDD, MASS). These are known less influenced by the length of texts.  

‚ñ∂Ô∏è **NLP tools ready to use:** (asof May 16, 2022)
