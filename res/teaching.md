# ðŸ“š **Tools ready to use: for students**

| Tools | Description |
|--|--|
|[Pronounce4me](https://github.com/MK316/Spring2023/blob/main/Pronounce4me.ipynb)|You can generate audio files of a text, which is also doanloadable. When you're preparing a presentation, you can use this too as a guideline. (Of course, you can be better than the AI speaker.)|
|[Story reading [^1]](https://github.com/MK316/applications/blob/main/Bedtimestory_tts.ipynb)| Generating a story(text) to an audio file. |
|[Oxford 3K voca audio [^2]](https://github.com/MK316/applications/blob/main/Oxford3K.ipynb)| You can select lists of words and generate audio files|

[^1]: This tool is basically the same with Pronounce4me.
[^2]: You can create audio files of words as you select (from number 1 to 3,000), and download them for your purpose. (e.g., learn frequently used 3K words and learn how to pronounce those words.)  => See description [ðŸ”— here](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/wordlists/oxford3000-5000)
For example, 3K words are listed with ID numbers and we'll create audio files using TTS (Text-to-Speech) tool:

| ID | WORD | ðŸ”ˆ [sample audio](/res/myaudio.mp4)|
