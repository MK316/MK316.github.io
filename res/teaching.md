# ðŸ“š **Tools ready to use: for students**

1. [Short story reading application](https://github.com/MK316/applications/blob/main/Bedtimestory_tts.ipynb)
2. [Oxford Learners' vocabulary 3K with sounds](https://github.com/MK316/applications/blob/main/Oxford3K.ipynb): You can create audio files of words as you select (from number 1 to 3,000), and download them for your purpose. (e.g., learn frequently used 3K words and learn how to pronounce those words.)
=> See description [ðŸ”— here](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/wordlists/oxford3000-5000)


For example, 3K words are listed with ID numbers and we'll create audio files using TTS (Text-to-Speech) tool:

| ID | WORD |  ðŸ”ˆ [sample audio](/res/myaudio.mp4)
|---|---|---|    
| 1 | the | |  
| 2 | of | |
