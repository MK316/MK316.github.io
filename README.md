(Nov.2023) MK316's Quote of the month:
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke, a renowned science fiction author
: When technology reaches a level of complexity and sophistication beyond our current understanding,
  it can seem as mysterious and wondrous as magic to those who encounter it.
