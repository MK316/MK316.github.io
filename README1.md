**◩-- [Goto - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING](/res/nlp_tools.md)**    
_This link includes the following tools_     

↳ **Frequency Analysis:** Creating Word Frequency list (csv file), creating Wordcloud with your text.   
↳ **Tagging:** Auto text tagging (Part of Speech: POS tagging) and create a wordlist including frequency, words, POS tags.   
↳ **Words in Contexts:** Concordance (showing contexts where target words occur), Collocation (words occurring together), N-gram (N words occuring together.  
↳ **Lexical Diversity:** 10 mostly used LD measures including TTR, LogTTR, RootTTR, etc. A tool with 3 main LD indices is also provided (MTLD, HDD, MASS). These are known less influenced by the length of texts.   
↳ **Basic Stats using R and Python:** Descriptive statistics (getting mean, SD, median, quartiles), Linear Regression, Hierarchical Clustering (Hclust analysis), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and basic plots including barchart, piechart, scatter plot.   


**◩-- [Goto - SPEECH PROCESSING](/res/sp_tools.md)**      
_This link includes the following tools_   

↳ **TTS (Text-To-Speech):** TTS (Text-to-Speech) in English, Korean, French, and Spanish.  
↳ **Pronunciation dictionary:** Finding rhyming words in English from English dictionary (This uses CMU pronounciation dictioinary)  
↳ Listenability (in progress).
