Parents' Day

She loved poppies. I planted new ones for her. I'm sure she is happy with them.

Mom's birthday

![image](/images/mainlogo01.png)

One day in January of 2020, my mom sent me a photo of this scene. She was so happy to enjoy the snow. It covered the whole mountain in white. The photo was really beautiful but I just texted her back with a short message, "Mom, it's very beautiful." Then I went back to my work; I thought I had more important things to do, than actually to call her asking how she feels.

In the same year, she passed away in October. It was a beautiful autumn day and the world seemed to cease to smile.

Winter came back that year. And one day I found the same scenery when I woke up. It was so quiet and I could only hear one bird singing around. I thought it must be her. She wanted to keep a bird but one feels lonely. She wanted to have multiple birds, but worried that they are too noisy to keep inside the house where she was living (the city).

In this peaceful place (North of Gyeonggi-do), birds can fly, sing, play with other birds as free as they could be. I want to keep the memory this way: she is enjoying this scenery and I feel happy to see this photo hearing the one special bird singing. 

So I took a photo of the same place (the one I have in the main page) and there's beautiful sound of silence. Now I can't tell the difference between the two photos: one from my mom and now from me. I hope we can talk about this beautiful moment together some day.

May her soul stay in peace.
