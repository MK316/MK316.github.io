Mom's birthday

![image](/images/mainlogo01.png)

One day in January of 2020, my mom sent me a photo of this scene. She was so happy to enjoy the snow. It covered the whole mountain in white. The photo was really beautiful but I just texted her with a short message, "Mom, it's beautiful." Then I went back to my work; I thought I had more important things to than actually calling her to ask how she feels.

In the same year, she passed away in October. It was a beautiful autumn day and the world seemed stop like that.

Winter came back that year. And one day I found the same scenery when I woke up. It was so quiet and I could only hear one bird singing around. I thought it must be her. She wanted to keep a bird but she thought birds are noisy... to keep inside the house where she was living.

In this place, birds can fly singing as free as they want. I want to keep the memory this way. 

And I took a photo of the same place and I can't tell the difference in the two photos.
One from my mom and now from me. I hope we can talk about this beautiful moment together.

May her soul stay in peace.
