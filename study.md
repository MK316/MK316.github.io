+ The transition towards intearctive digital learning places **a new set of responsibilities on academic faculty,** requiring them to develop new skills, such as digital literacy, online pedagogy, and methods for direct, interactive teaching in digital environments. This, in turn, has implications for faculty training, development, and support, as well as the design and delivery of courses involving digital literacy.
